// Experimental types for the trait query interface. The methods
// defined in this module are all based on **canonicalization**,
// which makes a canonical query by replacing unbound inference
// variables and regions, so that results can be reused more broadly.
// The providers for the queries defined here can be found in
// `rustc_traits`.

/// After we borrow check a closure, we are left with various
/// requirements that we have inferred between the free regions that
/// appear in the closure's signature or on its field types. These
/// requirements are then verified and proved by the closure's
/// creating function. This struct encodes those requirements.
///
/// The requirements are listed as being between various `RegionVid`. The 0th
/// region refers to `'static`; subsequent region vids refer to the free
/// regions that appear in the closure (or coroutine's) type, in order of
/// appearance. (This numbering is actually defined by the `UniversalRegions`
/// struct in the NLL region checker. See for example
/// `UniversalRegions::closure_mapping`.) Note the free regions in the
/// closure's signature and captures are erased.
///
/// Example: If type check produces a closure with the closure args:
///
/// ```text
/// ClosureArgs = [
///     'a,                                         // From the parent.
///     'b,
///     i8,                                         // the "closure kind"
///     for<'x> fn(&'<erased> &'x u32) -> &'x u32,  // the "closure signature"
///     &'<erased> String,                          // some upvar
/// ]
/// ```
///
/// We would "renumber" each free region to a unique vid, as follows:
///
/// ```text
/// ClosureArgs = [
///     '1,                                         // From the parent.
///     '2,
///     i8,                                         // the "closure kind"
///     for<'x> fn(&'3 &'x u32) -> &'x u32,         // the "closure signature"
///     &'4 String,                                 // some upvar
/// ]
/// ```
///
/// Now the code might impose a requirement like `'1: '2`. When an
/// instance of the closure is created, the corresponding free regions
/// can be extracted from its type and constrained to have the given
/// outlives relationship.

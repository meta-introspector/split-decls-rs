/// - **[sassers]** <code>0.11.0-<b>shitshow</b></code> &mdash; ???.

/// *Tip:* Be aware that if you are planning to number your own pre-releases,
/// you should prefer to separate the numeric part from any non-numeric
/// identifiers by using a dot in between. That is, prefer pre-releases
/// `alpha.1`, `alpha.2`, etc rather than `alpha1`, `alpha2` etc. The SemVer
/// spec's rule for pre-release precedence has special treatment of numeric
/// components in the pre-release string, but only if there are no non-digit
/// characters in the same dot-separated component. So you'd have `alpha.2` &lt;
/// `alpha.11` as intended, but `alpha11` &lt; `alpha2`.
///
/// # Syntax
///
/// Pre-release strings are a series of dot separated identifiers immediately
/// following the patch version. Identifiers must comprise only ASCII
/// alphanumerics and hyphens: `0-9`, `A-Z`, `a-z`, `-`. Identifiers must not be
/// empty. Numeric identifiers must not include leading zeros.
///
/// # Total ordering
///
/// Pre-releases have a total order defined by the SemVer spec. It uses
/// lexicographic ordering of dot-separated components. Identifiers consisting
/// of only digits are compared numerically. Otherwise, identifiers are compared
/// in ASCII sort order. Any numeric identifier is always less than any
/// non-numeric identifier.
///
/// Example:&ensp;`alpha`&ensp;&lt;&ensp;`alpha.85`&ensp;&lt;&ensp;`alpha.90`&ensp;&lt;&ensp;`alpha.200`&ensp;&lt;&ensp;`alpha.0a`&ensp;&lt;&ensp;`alpha.1a0`&ensp;&lt;&ensp;`alpha.a`&ensp;&lt;&ensp;`beta`

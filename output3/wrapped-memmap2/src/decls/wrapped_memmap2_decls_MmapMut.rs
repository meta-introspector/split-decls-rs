/// A handle to a mutable memory mapped buffer.
///
/// A file-backed `MmapMut` buffer may be used to read from or write to a file. An anonymous
/// `MmapMut` buffer may be used any place that an in-memory byte buffer is needed. Use
/// [`MmapMut::map_mut()`] and [`MmapMut::map_anon()`] to create a mutable memory map of the
/// respective types, or [`MmapOptions::map_mut()`] and [`MmapOptions::map_anon()`] if non-default
/// options are required.
///
/// A file backed `MmapMut` is created by `&File` reference, and will remain valid even after the
/// `File` is dropped. In other words, the `MmapMut` handle is completely independent of the `File`
/// used to create it. For consistency, on some platforms this is achieved by duplicating the
/// underlying file handle. The memory will be unmapped when the `MmapMut` handle is dropped.
///
/// Dereferencing and accessing the bytes of the buffer may result in page faults (e.g. swapping
/// the mapped pages into physical memory) though the details of this are platform specific.
///
/// `MmapMut` is [`Sync`] and [`Send`].
///
/// See [`Mmap`] for the immutable version.
///
/// ## Safety
///
/// All file-backed memory map constructors are marked `unsafe` because of the potential for
/// *Undefined Behavior* (UB) using the map if the underlying file is subsequently modified, in or
/// out of process. Applications must consider the risk and take appropriate precautions when using
/// file-backed maps. Solutions such as file permissions, locks or process-private (e.g. unlinked)
/// files exist but are platform specific and limited.

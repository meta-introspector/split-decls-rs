/// **SemVer version** as defined by <https://semver.org>.
///
/// # Syntax
///
/// - The major, minor, and patch numbers may be any integer 0 through u64::MAX.
///   When representing a SemVer version as a string, each number is written as
///   a base 10 integer. For example, `1.0.119`.
///
/// - Leading zeros are forbidden in those positions. For example `1.01.00` is
///   invalid as a SemVer version.
///
/// - The pre-release identifier, if present, must conform to the syntax
///   documented for [`Prerelease`].
///
/// - The build metadata, if present, must conform to the syntax documented for
///   [`BuildMetadata`].
///
/// - Whitespace is not allowed anywhere in the version.
///
/// # Total ordering
///
/// Given any two SemVer versions, one is less than, greater than, or equal to
/// the other. Versions may be compared against one another using Rust's usual
/// comparison operators.
///
/// - The major, minor, and patch number are compared numerically from left to
///   right, lexicographically ordered as a 3-tuple of integers. So for example
///   version `1.5.0` is less than version `1.19.0`, despite the fact that
///   "1.19.0" &lt; "1.5.0" as ASCIIbetically compared strings and 1.19 &lt; 1.5
///   as real numbers.
///
/// - When major, minor, and patch are equal, a pre-release version is
///   considered less than the ordinary release:&ensp;version `1.0.0-alpha.1` is
///   less than version `1.0.0`.
///
/// - Two pre-releases of the same major, minor, patch are compared by
///   lexicographic ordering of dot-separated components of the pre-release
///   string.
///
///   - Identifiers consisting of only digits are compared
///     numerically:&ensp;`1.0.0-pre.8` is less than `1.0.0-pre.12`.
///
///   - Identifiers that contain a letter or hyphen are compared in ASCII sort
///     order:&ensp;`1.0.0-pre12` is less than `1.0.0-pre8`.
///
///   - Any numeric identifier is always less than any non-numeric
///     identifier:&ensp;`1.0.0-pre.1` is less than `1.0.0-pre.x`.
///
/// Example:&ensp;`1.0.0-alpha`&ensp;&lt;&ensp;`1.0.0-alpha.1`&ensp;&lt;&ensp;`1.0.0-alpha.beta`&ensp;&lt;&ensp;`1.0.0-beta`&ensp;&lt;&ensp;`1.0.0-beta.2`&ensp;&lt;&ensp;`1.0.0-beta.11`&ensp;&lt;&ensp;`1.0.0-rc.1`&ensp;&lt;&ensp;`1.0.0`

/// On Windows, the polyfill consists of aliases of the socket types and
/// traits, For example, [`OwnedSocket`] is aliased to `OwnedFd`, and so on,
/// and there are blanket impls for `AsFd` etc. that map to `AsSocket` impls.
/// These blanket impls suffice for using the traits, however not for
/// implementing them, so this module also exports `AsSocket` and the other
/// traits as-is so that users can implement them if needed.
